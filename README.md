# GETTING STARTED 

- run 'npm install'
- create a database on render
- add the port number and external database url to the .env.example file in the appropriate place
- rename the .env.example file to .env
- run 'npm run reset-database' to add the required tables and data to the database
- run 'npm run dev' to start the server

# NOTES
- there is no UI for this application, so use an API tester software (such as Postman) to make requests to the server
- run 'npm run reset-database' at any point to return the database to its original state
